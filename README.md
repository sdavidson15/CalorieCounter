Calorie Counter
====================

Calorie Counter is a simple app I wrote a few days ago to help me keep track of the calories I eat.

## Why

I used to be a big fan of MyFitnessPal, but they have a feature overload. The impetus for this was that I wanted an app that was dead simple. There's just less to think about when using it, and you can really focus on the real driver of weight loss: calorie defficiencies.

## Details

#### Storage

This app tracks the smallest amount of data possible:
1. The name of your food.
2. How many calories the food was.
3. What time you ate it.

These entries are stored in the local file system (so no internet needed), and are organized by day.

#### Views

The views are equally simple. The main page shows, in large text, how many calories you've consumed that day. That's it.
There's a small button to add items as well, which adds to your total.

As added features, you can see a list of what you've eaten that day, or on previous days through a very simple navigation system on the details page. You get to the details page by holding down on the calorie total shown on the main page.

If you need to make changes, you can edit and delete items from the details view as well.
